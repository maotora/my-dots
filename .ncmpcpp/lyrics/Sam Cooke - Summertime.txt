It's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good looking
Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
No
No
No
No
Don't cry
Don't cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by
I know
Don't cry

Summertime
Summertime
Summertime and the living is
Living is easy
Fish are
I know the fish are jumping and cotton is so high
Your daddy is so
So rich and your mama good
She had to be good looking
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
No
No
Don't cry
No need to cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Summertime
