Once I was alone
So so lonely and then
You came out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills
Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, so warm, warm were your lips
Out there on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada
A change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you
And in your eyes
I found a love I couldn´t ignore
Down, down came the sun
Fast fast fast beat my heart
I knew, when the sunset
From that day we´d never part

A weekend in Canada
A change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you
And in your eyes
I found a love that I couldn´t ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast fast so fast fast beat my heart
I knew, when the suns et
From that day we´d never part
we´d never part, we´d never part
