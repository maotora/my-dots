Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone to keep a rendez-vous
I knew sometime, some place, somehow
You'd look at me, and I would see the smile you're smiling now

It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, or gay Paris, or even London town
No longer will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you

No longer will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you

I have found my world, found my world in you
