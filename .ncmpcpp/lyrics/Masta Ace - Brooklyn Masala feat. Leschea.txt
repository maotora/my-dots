Yeah
So sexy

[Verse 1]
I met her on the corner of Gates n Bedstuy
It was only right that I approached and said "hi"
Cuz she looked like no other chick I ever saw
She was on her way coming about the cornerstore
I axed "could I carry your bags?" and walk her home
I can tell she was new in New York, just from her tone
Cuz she wasn't that typical, rude and ignorant, teeth-sucking and
Eye-rolling tellin me to leave her alone (leave me alone)
We dipped and we yapped, we chit and we chat
About this and that and where she lived at, yeah
This may sound kinna Wu Tang Clan-ish
But this butter-pecan honey was not Spanish
She lived like 3 blocks from my man
In New York for 6 months, moved from Pakistan
Well that explains the strange accent and the strange clothes
And that cute little diamond in your nose
She said "I gotta wear this gear every Sonday, but..
You gotta see how I look on Monday" Word?!?
Mean that I can see you again? Maybe..
Give you a call... take you out on aweekend?
She winked at me and kinda laughed
Ripped a piece of the grocery bag and wrote her math
You can bet your last damn dollar
That I'mma give you a call... Brooklyn Masala

[Chorus]
Can we walk n talk, share our worlds?
I'm feelin you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number I'll holla, I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala
B to the K to the, B to the K to the
B to the K to the L to the Y to the N... Masala

[Verse 2]
On out first date knocked on the door around 8
When she came down she smelled good and looked great
She had the tight Frankie D'z on, white on white ones
A pink bubble goose and pink bubblegum, I'm like: DAMN!!!
Even pink Chanel shades, her long black hair was done up in boxbrades
She didn't had a Maybeline face that was all dead
Instead she had a red dot on her forehead
C-cup's pumpin, looking real ill
You wanna see Lord Of The Rings or Kill Bill?
She looked at me and said "Neither one
Caise there really ain't no black stars in either one."
So what you wanna do girl? She kinda blushed
And we settled on dinner for two at Justin's
The food was good, what no surprise is...
We had the barbeque shrimps as appetizers
We had the cat fish main course, a few drinks ...
Then out the front door like Main Source
We stepped out into the big city, she said
"The Times Square lights are so pretty"
We caught a cab, back to the lab
Stopped kissin long enough to pay the tab
She said "I think we got a nice future"
That night learned all about the Kama Sutra... my Masala

[Chorus]
