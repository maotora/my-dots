Darling you send me
I know you send me
Darling you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do, whoa

You thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling you, you, you, you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But wooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home, woah

You, you, you, you send me
I know you send me
I know you send me
Honest you do

Whoa, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know when I'm near you
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, honest you do, honest you do
Whoa, I know

I know, I know, I know, when you hold me
Whoa, whenever you kiss me
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But wooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

I know, I know, I know, you send me
I know you send me
Whoa, you you you you send me
Honest you do
