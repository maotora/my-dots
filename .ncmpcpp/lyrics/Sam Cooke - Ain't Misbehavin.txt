No one to walk with, all by myself,
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf.
Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', I'm savin' my love for you

I'm Like Jack Horner  in the corner,
I don't go nowhere,  what do I care,
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home a-bout eight, just me and my radio
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', savin' all of my love for you

No one to walk with, all by myself,
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf.
Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', I'm savin' my love for you

I'm like Jack Horner in the corner,
I don't go nowhere,  what do I care,
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, that's not for me
I'm home about eight, just quit looking at my tv
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', savin' all of my love for you
