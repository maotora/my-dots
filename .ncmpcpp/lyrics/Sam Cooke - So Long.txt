so long, so long
jee, I hate to see you go
you mean the world to me you know
you've been mine so long

so long, so long
hope we meet again some day
if we do I hope you'll say
darling, my mind was wrong

all alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
you're my own
even though we're oh so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart

so long, though you leave me and I cry?
this will never be goodbye
you've been mine so long

all alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
you're my own
even though we're oh so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart

so long, though you leave me in a pry?
this will never be goodbye
you've been mine so long
