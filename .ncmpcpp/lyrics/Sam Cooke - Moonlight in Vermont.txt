Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

I see finger waves
Ski-trails on a mountain side
Snow-light in Vermont

Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight In Vermont

(Pennies on a stream,
pennies, pennies, pennies on a stream)

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

I see finger waves
Ski-trails on a mountain side
Snow-light in Vermont

Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight In Vermont

You and I and moonlight in Vermont
