I hear the cottonwoods whispering above 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's my love! 
The old hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's my love! 
Does my darling feel what I feel 
When she comes near? 
My heart beats so joyfully 
you'd think that she could hear! 
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's my love! 

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know 
Tammy! Tammy! Can't let her go! 
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low 
Tammy! Tammy! You love her so! 
When the night is warm, soft and warm 
I long for her charms! 
I'd sing like a violin 
if she were in my arms 
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love!
