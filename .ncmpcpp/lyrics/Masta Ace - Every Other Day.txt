Yo, check this one here - murafaya!

If you want to be a winner
The streets, they cold, everybody turn sinner
So you can feel the heat, so you I bet her you gon' simmer
‘Cause everybody rep in their lunch and dinner

Hey! Hey! They say,
Every other day me see the signs of the times
No motherfucker, you'll never take mines
Every other day me see the fake-ass lies
Mull it all day, red eyes on the prize

Welcome everybody to the rap crucifixion
Every other day it’s like a brand new conviction
Another nigga down ‘cause he just didn’t listen
With the same mission, try'na get out this position

Listen, it doesn’t matter if you Muslim or Christian
Everybody need a little food in the kitchen
Hindus and Jews, they all feel the tension
And any other race or religion I didn’t mention, check it

You hit the streets try'na earn a little cheddar
Hoping that the cheddar make your life a little better
Walking through the hood in a hundred dollar sweater
Looking at these cats that you’re trying to stay ahead-a, ooh

See, what you facing is a wild situation
The hardest thing to do is try to be a little patient
Life's like a track, and, everybody racing
You about to get caught by the same shit you chasing, come on

If you want to be a winner
The streets, they cold, everybody turn sinner
So you can feel the heat, so you I bet her you gon' simmer
‘Cause everybody rep in their lunch and dinner

Watch this! They say,
Every other day me see the signs of the times
No motherfucker, you'll never take mines
Every other day we see the fake-ass lies
Mull it all day, red eyes on the prize

I hope one day it might be a little clearer
You wanna find the trouble? Take a look in the mirror
Mom’s tried to tell you, but you just didn’t hear her
Now every other day it’s like the end’s getting nearer, uh

Up in the clubs like I'm feelin' the terror
Every rapper fighting for a hit like Guerrera
So recognize we livin' in a new rap era
The money, cash, hoes; the Guantanam-era

Ain’t nothing changed,
Everybody still want the Benz and the Range
Everybody still want the gems and the chains
Everybody got a few friends in the game, and they still act strange

The only thing different is the color of the tint
The only thing different is the size of the rims
Now we got Foxy Browns and Little Kims
But they still fight, like Antoinette and MC Lyte, come on

If you want to be a winner
The streets, they cold, everybody turn sinner
So you can feel the heat, so you I bet her you gon' simmer
‘Cause everybody rep in their lunch and dinner

Watch it! Check it!
Every other day we see the signs of the times
No motherfucker, you'll never take mines
Every other day we see the fake-ass lies
Mull it all day, red eyes on the prize

Every other day we see the signs of the times
No motherfucker, you'll never take mines
Every other day we see the fake-ass lies
We mull it all day, red eyes on the prize

Eyes, on the prize
Red eyes on the prize..
On the prize..

If you’re out on the block, just turn up the music
You’re playing ball in the park, you can turn up the music
If you’re out on a bench, you can turn up the music
If you sitting in your living room, turn up the music

If you can’t pay your rent, you can turn up the music
If you’re slingin’ on the Ave, kid, turn up the music
If you’re tryna feed your family, turn up the music
Every other day, you can turn up the music

Yo, vitano hold me, I'm then gonna work this out
--- -- -- - <?>
Woke up by my lyrics 'cause I be round the round
Original style, versatile, I throw down

Them sculpted by talent like they're dirty like their souls
You bite one of my lines, I put sedatives in your mouth <?>
Involve my done pretender, the death been harshly
No mercy, sing Mr. Lee Gee

Don't tell me I can't do this or can't do that
Sing of my melodies and chant of my gat
I'm loaded and I will span-cock
For ja lit tracks, that ya drop

You cannot run away from what's got to be
And apply, <joanaindibeli on the C???>
Yo, well a dope emcee is a hot emcee
Mr. Lee Gee Monalibi Khali, yo

Every other day we see the signs of the times
No motherfucker, you'll never take mines
Every other day we see the fake-ass lies
We mull it all day, red eyes on the prize

Every other day we see the signs of the times..
